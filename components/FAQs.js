      question: "How long does the visa application process take?",
      answer:
        "Getting your visa sorted out can take a few weeks and how long exactly depends on the type of visa you’re applying for and how busy the German embassy or consulate in Kathmandu is. To make sure everything goes smoothly, it’s a good idea to kick off the process well before you plan to start your journey. That way, you’ll have plenty of time to handle everything without any stress. For more info, please follow the embassy website ( https://kathmandu.diplo.de/np-de )",

      question: "Is German language required?",
      answer:
        "In most cases, yes, but there are exceptions where it's not necessary. For instance, if you're coming for an English-taught program, or a job that has only English requirements, or your au pair speaks a language other than German, or your contract provider agrees to bring you without the language requirement and many other scenarios. It really depends on your unique situation, contract, and the type of visa you are applying for. Nevertheless, knowing German can be super helpful in your everyday life and when you're looking for a job. It adds an extra layer of ease and opens up more opportunities for you. If you would like to learn German, feel free to join the TGG German language WhatsApp Group ( https://chat.whatsapp.com/Eo05CiAwzLsDtfMeQvyJjU )",
