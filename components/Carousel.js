They patiently cleared every single doubt and were always ready to help at any time, no matter how small my query was.What I truly appreciated was how responsive and supportive they were, they answered all my questions quickly and made sure I understood everything clearly. When I was really worried about slot booking through the old method because of APS, they guided me calmly and helped me handle the situation without stress.At a time when most other consultancies were asking for huge fees just to book a slot, they never charged a penny and instead focused completely on helping me. From preparing all my documents to providing proper direction at every step, their support made the entire journey smooth and worry-free.Highly recommend The German Guy to anyone starting their journey, they really care and go above and beyond to help.",
